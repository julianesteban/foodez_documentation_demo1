To whom it may concern,

All three of the above items, the help folder, and the documentation PDF,
and documentation CHM are the same thing, in different forms. The help
folder contains the documentation in html form and is our preferred way
for you to access our technical documentation.

To access the html, first enter the Help folder, then select the "index" html
document.

Thank you,
the foodez team
