To whom it may concern,

Testing was conducted through the use of a Windows Phone 8.1 emulator. Since our project is a 
mobile application, running through use cases and user stories using an emulator was employed in lieu 
of using formal unit testing frameworks and scripts. During implementation of each feature, strenuous unit testing was 
conducted to ensure that each feature worked as expected: all values displayed were accurate and all interactions with the database
had the desired effects. Integration testing was done by ensuring that the app performed flawlessly after each feature was integrated
one by one. Again, use cases and user stories were used to interact with the app and ensure that expected results were yielded 
for both the elements stored in database, and correct navigation of the application. Data collection scripts were not utilized for 
our mobile application. For these reasons, unit testing, integration testing, and data collection scripts and folders are 
not part of our submitted documentation and are marked with a "..._NOTAPPLICABLE" designation in the sub-folder screen.
Consequently, we ask that the points be reallocated to the code and documentation sections of this demo 1 
documents submission. Thank you very much for your time, we hope you enjoyed our demo.


Thanks,
